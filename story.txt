In Berlin, a man is selling Bratwurst.
Little do they know, this man is secretly a gauss studying human behavior.
Through his studies, he has come up with a Schnapsidee. 
This schnapsidee caused him to take a break from studying and go to the local biergarten where he met a member of Rammstein.
The member said he just came from Lederhose.
Turns out he was actually the husband of Schneewittchen.
He told the the man that he's going to build a luftschloss for Schneewittchen and asked if he wanted to help and promised that he'll get the best bratwurst in return.
