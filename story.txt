In Berlin, a man is selling Bratwurst.
Little do they know, this man is secretly a gauss studying human behavior.
Through his studies, he has come up with a Schnapsidee. 
This schnapsidee caused him to take a break from studying and go to the local biergarten where he met a member of Rammstein.
The member said he just came from Lederhose.
Turns out he was actually the husband of Schneewittchen.
He told the the man that he's going to build a luftschloss for Schneewittchen and asked if he wanted to help and promised that he'll get the best bratwurst in return.
The two men agreed and the gauss offered to drive them in his BMW.
Realizing that they were passing the Nurburgring, they thought that it would be a good idea to do a lap to see what all the fuss is about.
The member of Rammstein said he'd put some of his best musik on to inspire him to drive faster.
The gauss grew hot from the intense focus of driving the Ring, but he refused to put the klimaanlage on to ensure they lost no performance. 
Suddenly, the bratwurst seller awoke from his kopfkino in the corner of the biergarten. As he looked around he realized that he was not a gauss, had no BMW and there was no famous rocker sitting next to him. There was however, a very empty stein with just a dribble of doppelbock left at the bottom. 
So he picked up his Brot and went to the Flughafen.
